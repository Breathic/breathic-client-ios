Breathic is a fitness focused Apple Watch app that manages breathing cycles for a user through heart or movement activity. It does that by measuring users heartbeat, speed or steps, which is then followed by triggering audible as well as haptic events that will indicate user when it will be a good time to either breathe in or breathe out.

In order to start a new session, make sure you are looking at Controller of the app where the Pace toggle allows for basing your breathing cycles to be calculated either through hearbeats/s, steps/s or speed/s. Generally, all pace modes will work for running, but currently just heartbeats and speed are good for cycling, and just heartbeats will be usable when using it for indoor activities.

Next up, hit Rhythm tab from Controller, which will open a view that allows for changing the multiplier for breath (either both in and out, or just out when using the picker on the right). If you previously had chosen heartbeats for pace, then using rhythm of 1:1 when your heartbeat is on 1bps (or 60bpm) will mean it will do half a breathing cycle per second (or 30bpm). If you are to increase the rhythm to 2:2, then the breathing feedback will become slower by a factor of 2. If you start working out and your heartbeat goes from 60 to 120bpm, then the apps breathing rate will also increase by a factor of 2. Breathing rates will, however, be reversed for both step and speed inputs, so if you had either selected for pace and were to increase the rhythm, you will also increase the number of breathing cycles.

Thirdly, start a session by hitting the Session button. By default, haptic feedback will be the preferred mode while audio will be muted, but you can use the crown of your Apple Watch to bring the volume up, and use earplugs/headphones of your choice that you have paired to your watch. Do make sure the audio output device displays connected under watch's bluetooth settings.

If you previously chose heartbeats for the pace (or steps/speed and have since begun starting to walk), and are now wearing the watch on your hand, then it should be giving you haptic or audible feedback. If you pan the Controller view to left, you will see Status view with all the relevant metrics.

After finishing a session, hit the Session button again for either saving or discarding session metrics. Saved sessions with relevant overview data as well as a graph will appear under Log view that you can select from the burger menu.

If for some reason you made a mistake of not approving access for heartrate and/or location derived speed the first time, then you should be able to correct it by removing the app from your watch, and then having it reinstalling it again.
